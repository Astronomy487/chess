rules_description = "The rules of check in a standard chess game prevent any player from ever putting their own king in danger. It is physically impossible to lose a king; checkmate is defined as the moment the king cannot escape danger. Though the two kings present themselves as adversaries to their subordinates, they are not. They hold a complicit agreement that, regardless of how many ordinary pieces die, the kings cannot die. They are immortalized by their power.</p><p>In this chess variant, the enemy is not those of opposite color running forth to kill you; the enemy is the king who commands you die in the name of pledging allegiance to them above your compatriots.";
